# My personal site hosted on GitHub pages

This site will be gradually enhanced.

Currently I am working on Release 1.

Release 1 will contain static pages.

Release 2 will contain enhanced static pages with more menus.

Release 3 will target to shift the site to AWS or Oracle Cloud, whichever comes out to be cheaper or more convenient to use.

Decision will be frozen at the start of Release 3 by conducting a POC.
